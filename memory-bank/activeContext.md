## Current Goals

- Completing alignment review between Agent and Panel systems. Critical protocol misalignment discovered - Panel Issue #27 introduced breaking changes with new command format that Agent doesn't support. Need to implement handlePanelCommand() method and update message structures while maintaining backwards compatibility. Current priority is updating Agent protocol to work with Panel's new unified command format.
