# Ctrl-Alt-Play Agent - Distributed Game Server Management

## Purpose

Define the main purpose of this project.

## Target Users

Describe who will use this.


## Project Summary

A lightweight, production-ready game server management agent that enables the Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel to manage Docker-based game servers on remote Linux systems. Built with Go for performance and reliability, it provides real-time bidirectional communication with the Panel through WebSocket connections, comprehensive Docker container management, robust monitoring capabilities, and secure operations. The Agent serves as the distributed execution layer in a Panel+Agent architecture, handling container lifecycle, resource monitoring, and command execution while maintaining seamless integration with the central Panel system.
