# MemoriPilot: System Architect

## Overview
This file contains the architectural decisions and design patterns for the MemoriPilot project.

## Architectural Decisions

- Dual communication architecture with HTTP API and WebSocket client
- Combined health and API server on single port (8081)
- Graceful WebSocket connection failure handling
- Panel-compatible authentication using X-API-Key header



- Use Go for performance, Docker API integration, and concurrent operations
- WebSocket for real-time Panel communication with automatic reconnection
- Environment variables for configuration management and deployment flexibility
- HTTP endpoint for health monitoring and external service integration
- Dual protocol support for Panel compatibility during migration period
- Structured JSON logging for operational visibility and debugging
- Graceful shutdown with proper container cleanup and resource deallocation
- Bearer token authentication for secure Panel communication
- Docker API for direct container management without shell dependencies



- Use Go for performance and Docker API integration
- WebSocket for real-time Panel communication
- Environment variables for configuration management
- HTTP endpoint for health monitoring
- Dual protocol support for Panel compatibility
- Structured logging for operational visibility
- Graceful shutdown for container safety

3. **Decision 3**: Description of the decision and its rationale.



## Design Considerations

- Panel expects HTTP API for discovery and commands
- Agent needs WebSocket for real-time communication
- Single port design simplifies deployment
- Graceful degradation when panel unavailable



- Security: Bearer token authentication, secure Docker operations, and minimal privilege execution
- Performance: Efficient message handling, Docker API optimization, and resource management
- Reliability: Automatic reconnection, error recovery, and graceful degradation
- Compatibility: Support both new Panel protocol and legacy message types during migration
- Monitoring: Comprehensive health checks, metrics collection, and status reporting
- Deployment: Easy configuration via environment variables and containerized deployment
- Scalability: Support for multiple concurrent server management and resource optimization
- Maintainability: Clean code architecture, comprehensive logging, and documentation



- Security: Bearer token authentication and secure Docker operations
- Performance: Efficient message handling and Docker API usage
- Reliability: Automatic reconnection and error recovery
- Compatibility: Support both new and legacy Panel protocols
- Monitoring: Comprehensive health checks and status reporting
- Deployment: Easy configuration via environment variables



## Components
