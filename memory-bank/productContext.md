# Product Context

## Overview

Ctrl-Alt-Play Agent is a lightweight, production-ready game server management agent designed to work seamlessly with the Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel system. It serves as the distributed execution layer in a Panel+Agent architecture, enabling centralized management of game servers across multiple remote Linux systems.

## Project Description

The Agent functions similarly to the "Wings" system found in Pelican Panel and Pterodactyl Panel, providing a secure and efficient bridge between the central Panel and Docker-based game servers. It handles the complete lifecycle of game server containers, from creation and configuration to monitoring and cleanup, while maintaining real-time communication with the Panel for immediate status updates and command execution.

**Current Status**: Requires protocol updates to align with Panel's Issue #27 breaking changes that introduced a new unified command format.

## Core Features

- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based bidirectional messaging with the Panel
- **Docker Integration**: Complete container lifecycle management via Docker API
- **Security**: Bearer token authentication and secure container operations
- **Health Monitoring**: HTTP endpoint for system health checks and status reporting
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Robust connection handling with heartbeat mechanism
- **Resource Management**: Monitor and report system and container resource usage
- **Log Streaming**: Real-time server console output streaming to Panel
- **File Operations**: Basic file management capabilities for server configurations
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown and container cleanup on termination

## Architecture

**Distributed Panel+Agent System**:
- Agent runs on remote nodes with Docker access
- Communicates with central Panel via WebSocket (port 8080)
- Uses Docker API for container lifecycle management
- Bearer token authentication for secure Panel communication
- Heartbeat mechanism maintains connection health (30-second intervals)
- HTTP health check endpoint for monitoring (configurable port)

**Recent Changes**: Panel Issue #27 introduced breaking changes requiring Agent protocol updates for new unified command format.
