# Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-07-24 | Adopt Panel's comprehensive memory bank and chat mode system for Agent development | The Panel system has a sophisticated memory bank with rich project context, architectural decisions, and development patterns. To maintain consistency and ensure seamless collaboration between Panel and Agent development, the Agent should adopt the same memory bank structure and chat mode system. This will provide better context continuity and align with the established development methodology. |
| 2025-07-24 | Update Agent to handle Panel Issue #27 breaking changes | The Panel has completed Issue #27 which introduced a new command protocol format. The Agent currently uses the old message type format and will not be compatible with the Panel's new command structure. Need to implement the new handlePanelCommand() method and message structures while maintaining backwards compatibility for existing functionality. |
