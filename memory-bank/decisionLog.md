# Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-07-24 | Adopt Panel's comprehensive memory bank and chat mode system for Agent development | The Panel system has a sophisticated memory bank with rich project context, architectural decisions, and development patterns. To maintain consistency and ensure seamless collaboration between Panel and Agent development, the Agent should adopt the same memory bank structure and chat mode system. This will provide better context continuity and align with the established development methodology. |
| 2025-07-24 | Update Agent to handle Panel Issue #27 breaking changes | The Panel has completed Issue #27 which introduced a new command protocol format. The Agent currently uses the old message type format and will not be compatible with the Panel's new command structure. Need to implement the new handlePanelCommand() method and message structures while maintaining backwards compatibility for existing functionality. |
| 2025-07-24 | Prioritize protocol compatibility updates over new features | The Panel+Agent protocol misalignment is a blocking issue that prevents the Agent from working with the current Panel system. All new feature development should be paused until the Agent is updated to handle the Panel's Issue #27 command format. This ensures basic functionality works before adding enhancements, following a stability-first approach to development. |
| 2025-07-24 | Maintain clean and comprehensive memory bank documentation | The memory bank system is critical for maintaining project context and ensuring development continuity. Clean, well-structured documentation prevents confusion and enables effective collaboration. Regular memory bank updates ensure all team members have access to current project state, architectural decisions, and development priorities. |
